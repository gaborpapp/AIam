better input state detection:
 - expected durations
 - expected set of moves
 - replace strict limits with probabilities?

configurable idle behaviour
 - sigmoid?

unison movement
 - sync/mirror is entirely still too much
  - fix bug in sync causing it to sometimes output relative positions greater than 1
 - tweak idle instead?

invent: perform transitions between inter-state positions

echo_or_improvise: needs to be patient when waiting for next thing to echo, before improvising, or guess MC

learn: perform moves in a manner which reflects statistical patterns in the input (HMM)
