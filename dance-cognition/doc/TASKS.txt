better input state detection

sync/mirror is entirely still too much

render only allowed moves (the moves between mc, mlb, ml, hb, mb, mlf)

combine mirror+echo
- handle situation where we are waiting to switch to echo, but dancer stays in middle: perhaps sway while waiting?

combine mirror+improvise
combine mirror+echo+improvise

invent: perform transitions between inter-state positions
combine mirror+echo+improvise+invent?

test with input that contains unknown moves

fix bug in sync causing it to sometimes output relative positions greater than 1

learn: perform moves in a manner which reflects statistical patterns in the input (HMM)
