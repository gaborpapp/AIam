echo should never follow into a non-dataset state (such as MRB). now it leads to an exception if it does.

combine idle+echo
combine idle+echo+improvise

better input state detection:
 - expected durations
 - expected set of moves
 - replace strict limits with probabilities?

combine idle+echo+mirror+improvise
sync/mirror is entirely still too much

invent: perform transitions between inter-state positions
combine mirror+echo+improvise+invent?

test with input that contains unknown moves

fix bug in sync causing it to sometimes output relative positions greater than 1

learn: perform moves in a manner which reflects statistical patterns in the input (HMM)
