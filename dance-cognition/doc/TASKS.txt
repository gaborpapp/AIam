echo should never follow into a non-dataset state (such as MRB). now it leads to an exception if it does.

sync/mirror is entirely still too much

better input state detection: replace strict limits with probabilities?

invent: perform transitions between inter-state positions
combine mirror+echo+improvise+invent?

test with input that contains unknown moves

fix bug in sync causing it to sometimes output relative positions greater than 1

learn: perform moves in a manner which reflects statistical patterns in the input (HMM)
