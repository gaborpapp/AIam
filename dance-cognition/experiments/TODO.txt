2d/3d map visualization during improv (possibly with path)

nicer looking limbs?

shadow?


exception when velocity in GUI is empty (or 0?)

improvisation
  eliminate possible infinite loop when min_distance is high
  eliminate exception caused by path being too short (occurs now and then)
  parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py

singular matrix exception:
  rm scenes/valencia_all.bvh.quaternion.10fps.data && python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_all.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  see tournier09.pdf
  use exponential maps instead? (see e.g. Expressive Gait Synthesis Using PCA and Gaussian Modeling, paper119)
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

follow
  test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)

real-time interaction
  switch between interaction modes (follow, improvise etc)?
  more real-time modes in addition to "follow"?
  use mapping as output only with old state-based input?

interactive evolution of trajectories?
