more instant effect of changing velocity

separate backend and UI
  HTML5 UI prototype
    offline access to jquery
  occasional crash on startup when running --ui-only: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'text_message'
    seems to appear only with ai_am client & server, not when either client or server is bare (tornado/ws4py)!
  optimization: don't send events to non-subscribing clients
    don't send input or output to HTML5 UI
    don't even process output if noone subscribes to OUTPUT
  --export-stills
  start/stop plot reduction
  TypeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
    when running in single process with -frame-rate=1

parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py

remove joints with static orientation from training / dim.reduction?

singular matrix exception:
  rm scenes/valencia_all.bvh.quaternion.10fps.data && python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_all.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  see tournier09.pdf
  use exponential maps instead? (see e.g. Expressive Gait Synthesis Using PCA and Gaussian Modeling, paper119)
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

follow
  test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)

real-time interaction
  switch between interaction modes (follow, improvise etc)?
  more real-time modes in addition to "follow"?
  use mapping as output only with old state-based input?

interactive evolution of trajectories?
