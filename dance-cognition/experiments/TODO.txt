improvisation
  eliminate exception caused by path being too short (occurs now and then)
  parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py
  pull towards periphery also when novelty is low

singular matrix exception:
  rm scenes/valencia_all.bvh.quaternion.10fps.data && python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_all.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

follow
  test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)

real-time interaction
  switch between interaction modes (follow, improvise etc)?
  more real-time modes in addition to "follow"?
  use mapping as output only with old state-based input?

interactive evolution of trajectories?
