validate/improve rotation parametrization (using quaternions?)
  visualize quaternion representation + its antipodal inverse, to see if antipodal symmetry explains encountered problems with discontinuity (angle_3dim_quaternion)
  test using joint ranges (mean+limits)
add movement across space to hierarchical parametrization
test dim reduction with higher training data frame rate
explore random trajectories within dense areas of reduction space
