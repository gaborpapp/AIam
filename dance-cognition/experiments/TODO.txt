automatic detection of whether training data cache can be used (currently, it needs to be removed manually when some parameter such as --translation-weight is changed)
  perhaps using profiles?
explore random trajectories within dense areas of reduction space
ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py
interactive evolution of trajectories?
