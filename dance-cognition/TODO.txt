tracking:
  dealing with multiple users
  remove/reduce joint smoothing (and add support for toggle to display with or without smoothing)
  consider confidence?
  don't process ignored joints (at least not when viewer isn't used)


external fullscreen

investigate adding pelvis

reduce interaction latency
  abort current path when parameters change a lot?

ability to replay entire interaction
  log improv w timestamps?

prevent floor from disappearing when avatar moves a lot

replace our skeleton smoothing with nite::UserTracker::setSkeletonSmoothingFactor?

protection against hypothetical runtime exception in interpolation of improvised path (see plot_observations.py)

perhaps training data for BVHs should use all motion frames by default, rather than sampling the BVH with a mandatory frame rate
  see similar issue in plot_observations.py

investigate discontinuities in map trajectories within BVHs, causing the need for splitting by distance threshold (in map_widget.py and plot_observations.py)
  related to quaternion discontinuity problem? (see below)

parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py

singular matrix exception:
  python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_kinect/*.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  see tournier09.pdf
  use exponential maps instead? (see e.g. Expressive Gait Synthesis Using PCA and Gaussian Modeling, paper119)
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)
