re-create floor renderer when color scheme changed interactively

zoom in/out when user enters/leaves active area?

ability to replay entire interaction (tracking + improv/rendering)
  log improv w timestamps?
  or perhaps all events used by renderer?

investigate adding pelvis
  torso moves much less than hands, some kind of joint-specific weighting can compensate for this

tracker: don't create depth stream if not recording to or playing back from ONI file

protection against hypothetical runtime exception in interpolation of improvised path (see plot_observations.py)

investigate why the pose mapping behaves differently Alex' two PCs with ubuntu (12.04 vs 14.04). right now different preferred locations need to be configured.
  possible clue: valencia_quaternion_7d_friction.data has different file sizes
  different numpy versions? (sklearn already excluded, since both run 0.14 now)


perhaps training data for BVHs should use all motion frames by default, rather than sampling the BVH with a mandatory frame rate
  see similar issue in plot_observations.py

investigate discontinuities in map trajectories within BVHs, causing the need for splitting by distance threshold (in map_widget.py and plot_observations.py)
  related to quaternion discontinuity problem? (see below)

parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py

singular matrix exception:
  python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_kinect/*.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  see tournier09.pdf
  use exponential maps instead? (see e.g. Expressive Gait Synthesis Using PCA and Gaussian Modeling, paper119)
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)
