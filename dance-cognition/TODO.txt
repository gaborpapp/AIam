tracking:
  dealing with multiple users
  consider confidence?

select preferred location as initial "departure"

change floor orientation for improved aeshetics?


perhaps training data for BVHs should use all motion frames by default, rather than sampling the BVH with a mandatory frame rate
  see similar issue in plot_observations.py

investigate discontinuities in map trajectories within BVHs, causing the need for splitting by distance threshold (in map_widget.py and plot_observations.py)
  related to quaternion discontinuity problem? (see below)

prevent floor from disappearing when avatar moves a lot

protection against hypothetical runtime exception in interpolation of improvised path (see plot_observations.py)

parametrize 0.3 in navigator.py

singular matrix exception:
  python dim_reduce.py hierarchical -r quaternion -bvh scenes/valencia_kinect/*.bvh -training-data-frame-rate 10 -train -n 7 --translate --translation-weight 10

ensure that quaternion discontinuity problem (see README) cannot appear in real cases
  see tournier09.pdf
  use exponential maps instead? (see e.g. Expressive Gait Synthesis Using PCA and Gaussian Modeling, paper119)
  work started with analyze_quaternions.py

investigate whether usage of non-normalized quaternion values (in explore and improv) causes problems

follow
  test ability to generalize to unseen input (e.g. by dividing data into train and test)

real-time interaction
  switch between interaction modes (follow, improvise etc)?
  more real-time modes in addition to "follow"?
  use mapping as output only with old state-based input?

interactive evolution of trajectories?
